# Creating a Neural Network Architecture with GoLang
This was an assignment for the course CSE-465 at North South University. The task was to create a neural network architecture using Go-Lang.

### Task
* Determine a representation of a computational graph
* Implement a method to mark the trainable paramters
* Implement an initialization of said parameters
* Implement a method to provide the training data
* Implement backpropagation and gradient descent
* Assume MSE loss
* Must be an implementation for both vector and scalar values
* Implement a CNN filter of any dimension
* Implement Max Pooling


### How to run the code:

For the scalar version:

```
go run scalar_nn.go
```

For the vector version:

```
cd v2
go run vector_nn.go
```
